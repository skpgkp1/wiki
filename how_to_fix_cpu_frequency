#Check cpu frequency

$ sudo cpupower -c 1 frequency-info
analyzing CPU 1:
  driver: intel_cpufreq
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 1
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 1
  maximum transition latency: 20.0 us
  hardware limits: 1000 MHz - 3.70 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil
  current policy: frequency should be within 2.00 GHz and 2.00 GHz.
                  The governor "userspace" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 2.00 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
